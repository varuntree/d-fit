Our certification bundlesâ€”Basic, Classic, and Premiumâ€”are thoughtfully created to give you flexibility and value, no matter your level of experience.

But it doesn't end there. Through IFPA, you gain access to a wide range of specialized certifications in areas such as Yoga, Pilates, Sports Nutrition, Kettlebell Training, Sport-Specific Programs, Fitness Business Management, and moreâ€”giving you the freedom to shape a career path that fits your vision.

We also support your long-term growth. Our collection of Continuing Education Unit (CEU) courses not only helps maintain your certification but offers practical, real-world knowledge that enhances your skills and impact as a trainer.

**Note:** Our certifications are internationally accredited through IFPA (USA) and recognized in over 30 countries. While they are ideal for professional development and employment in many fitness environments, they are not nationally recognized qualifications in Australia under the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF).

At D-FIT Academy, we're here to help you grow, inspire, and create meaningful change in your fitness careerâ€”one certification at a time.

## About Section
**Title:** "Our Story"

**Content:**
D-FIT Academy was born from a legacy of passion and expertise. It all began over 20 years ago with Dahanni Center in Lebanon - a trusted name in health, fitness, and transformation.

What started as a single fitness center has evolved into an international academy, dedicated to shaping certified professionals and empowering future fitness leaders. Today, as an official IFPA affiliate in Australia, we bring world-class education, practical experience, and global recognition to every student.

From Lebanon to Australia, our mission remains the same:
To turn passion into purpose â€” and learners into leaders.
